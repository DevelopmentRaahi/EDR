Frequently Asked Questions: (h2)

1. What is Endpoint Detection and Response?(h3)
Endpoint Detection Response is an endpoint cybersecurity solution that detects, investigates and responds to threats on desktops, laptops and servers. It uses continuous monitoring, real time analytics, and automated responses to protect against advanced threat.
2. Why is EDR so important to businesses?(h3)
EDR is important because it:
●	Real-time Threat Detection
●	Investigation and analysis of incidents
●	Automated response for threat mitigation.
●	Protect yourself from advanced malware, ransomware and file less attacks.
3. What is EDR?(h3)
EDR tools use machine learning, threat intelligence, and behavioral analysis to detect and respond malicious activity. The key components are:
●	Continuous monitoring.
●	Data collection and Analysis
●	Prioritization and alert generation.
●	Automated or Manual Threat Response

4. What is the difference between EDR and endpoint?(h3)
Endpoints are any devices connected to a computer network (e.g. laptops and servers). Endpoint Detection and Response is a solution for security that monitors and detects threats on these devices. EDR is more advanced than basic endpoint protection. It provides forensic analysis and real-time automated/manual response capabilities.
5. What is the difference between EDR and antivirus software?(h3)
EDR is a powerful alternative to traditional antivirus software that relies on signature-based detection.
●	Advanced behavioral analysis
●	The detection of unknown threats, zero-day attacks and other unknown threats.
●	Forensic abilities for detailed investigations.
●	Stop active threats in real-time with a response that is immediate.
6. What factors should I consider before choosing an EDR?(h3)
Consider these factors when selecting an EDR system:
●	Scalability that matches your organization's scale.
●	Real-time threat detection capabilities and response capability.
●	Easy deployment and use.
●	Integrate existing security tools
●	Support and reputation of the vendor.
